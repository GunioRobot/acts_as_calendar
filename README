== Acts As Calendar

This rails plugin aims to provide support for calendar events, both discrete and recurring. The goal is to be able to attach a calendar to any model object, and to attach calendar events to any of that object's children or possibly descendents. The calendar data should be publishable in ical format, and possibly editable from as well, to the extent that the data model allows.

Events may occur on specific dates, recur monthly on a given day (the 15th), a given day of a given week (1st Thursday, Last Saturday), or a given weekday (Every Friday), or any combination of the above.

Recurring events are stored as patterns in the database, and are joined against a table of dates, decomposed into parts, into a view of event instances. This has the advantages of being easy and efficient to query, and of bypassing the typically non-standard database date functions. The disadvantage, of course, is that it requires a table of all potential dates against which to join. That being said, a century's worth of date data should only be a few hundred kilobytes, not large by today's standards. The limiting factor at the moment is in initially populating these data, it's fairly slow with ActiveRecord.
